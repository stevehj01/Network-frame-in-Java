These two java programs simulate a networking algorithm.  

At a high level, the LinkSender program will take a text file, break it down into 16 character segments and put them into frames.  The frames are structured with additional information to simulate a networking frame.  Once the frame is created, and it is then transmitted to the LinkReceive program.  The LinkReceive program will receive these frames, extract the data, and post the data to an output file.
